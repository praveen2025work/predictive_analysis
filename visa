Subject: Request for Short-Term UK Relocation in Light of U.S. Immigration Constraints**

Dear [Manager’s Name / Leadership Team],

I would like to bring to your attention a pressing immigration challenge that has a direct impact on my ability to continue working in the U.S. My H1B status has been valid since 2015, with an approved I-140 in 2016. However, the green card backlog in my category has advanced only to February 2013, which effectively places my case decades away from resolution.

This prolonged delay creates significant difficulties: long-term residency remains uncertain, international travel is restricted, and flexibility to take on new roles or assignments is limited. These immigration barriers are outside my control but directly affect my ability to plan ahead and sustain my work in the U.S. without risk of disruption.

To overcome this challenge, I kindly request your support in considering a short-term relocation of approximately one year to our UK office. This arrangement would provide the necessary visa stability, remove the immediate immigration hurdles, and allow me to continue contributing fully to the company’s priorities.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,
Praveen Kumar
