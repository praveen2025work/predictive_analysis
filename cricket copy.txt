Subject: Update on CDW Wijmo Grid License Renewal

Dear Sunny, Bunty, and Montey,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to update you on the CDW Wijmo Grid license renewal following our recent DCP call, during which Montey provisionally approved our request.

I appreciate Sunnyâ€™s suggestion to explore Tableau as an alternative. After discussions with Bunty, I understand that, given our budget constraints, a full migration to Tableau is not feasible at this time. However, we can consider it as part of our long-term strategy when budget allows.

In the meantime, I recommend proceeding with the renewal of the Wijmo license to ensure we continue to meet our operational needs.

I welcome any thoughts or questions you may have, as your feedback is invaluable.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
